		<h3>My Introduction</h3>
		<div>My name is Shruti Mishra. I am pursuing my B. tech in Electronics and communication branch from KIET group of institutions. I have been born and bought up in the largest district of uttar pradesh, lakhimpur-kheri. I have done my senior secondary studies from CBSE board,English medium with the percentage of 88.2% and got my higher secondary education from UP board,Hindi medium with the percentage of 83.33%. My higher and senior senior secondary education shows that I am a very hard working student. One more interesting thing about my higher and secondary education is that I have done my higher education from lakhimpur and done my senior secondary education from lucknow which is 140km away from my birthplace it shows that I am very adjustable with new places. I was the team leader of my school kho-kho team and we played national level games two times 1st was in class 5th and second time in class 6th . I am the co-leader of the official dance society of my college, phoenix dance crew. These activities shows that I am a team player since my childhood. When I went to pursue my senior secondary education I had to elect my optional subject and I opted for C++ because of my love towards coding. Tell something about them and then say it shows that I am a very good observer. I am a very good manager also as I am in a group so many times we have to go to different places for performing. There are 30 members in my group. As I have told u earlier that I m the leader of the group so going somewhere with 30 people and managing them is a quality which everyone does not have. Till class 12th I was studying in a girls school and from there to a engineering college where boys and girls ratio is 70:30 it shows that I become comfortable in new environment easily. In this quarentien I discovered that I have skills of writing, so whenever I am sad or I donâ€™t wanna talk to anyone than I just write. So this is the brief introduction of me.</div>
